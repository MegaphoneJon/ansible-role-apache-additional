# Changing the following options will not really affect the security of the
# server, but might make attacks slightly more difficult in some cases.

#
# ServerTokens
# This directive configures what you return as the Server HTTP response
# Header. The default is 'Full' which sends information about the OS-Type
# and compiled in modules.
# Set to one of:  Full | OS | Minimal | Minor | Major | Prod
# where Full conveys the most information, and Prod the least.
ServerTokens Prod

#
# Optionally add a line containing the server version and virtual host
# name to server-generated pages (internal error documents, FTP directory
# listings, mod_status and mod_info output etc., but not CGI generated
# documents or custom error documents).
# Set to "EMail" to also include a mailto: link to the ServerAdmin.
# Set to one of:  On | Off | EMail
ServerSignature Off

#
# Allow TRACE method
#
# Set to "extended" to also reflect the request body (only for testing and
# diagnostic purposes).
#
# Set to one of:  On | Off | extended
TraceEnable Off
#TraceEnable On

#
# Forbid access to version control directories
#
# If you use version control systems in your document root, you should
# probably deny access to their directories.
#
# Examples:
#
RedirectMatch 404 /\.git
RedirectMatch 404 /\.svn
RedirectMatch 404 /wp-cron.php
RedirectMatch 404 /wp-config.php
RedirectMatch 404 /wp-admin/install.php

#
# Setting this header will prevent MSIE from interpreting files as something
# else than declared by the content type in the HTTP headers.
# Requires mod_headers to be enabled.
#
Header always set X-Content-Type-Options: "nosniff"
# Let's not do *always* on a HSTS request - failures shouldn't get HSTS.
Header set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=2592000; includeSubdomains"
Header always set Referrer-Policy no-referrer-when-downgrade
Header always edit Set-Cookie "(?i)^((?:(?!;\s?HttpOnly).)+)$" "$1; HttpOnly"
Header always edit Set-Cookie "(?i)^((?:(?!;\s?secure).)+)$" "$1; secure"

# We're gonna need to change this to embed iframes in other sites though. Might delegate this to the CMS later.
Header set X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
# Hides PHP usage/version
Header always unset X-Powered-By
Header always set Permissions-Policy "geolocation=(),midi=(),microphone=(),camera=(),magnetometer=(),gyroscope=(),fullscreen=(self),payment=()"
